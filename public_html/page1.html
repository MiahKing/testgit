Growing microgreens can be a very rewarding experience for people with all ages and skills levels. In my experience, you don’t need to be a green thumb, nor do you need a lot of space in order to get your own little microgreen farm growing. With just a few items and a little bit of patience, you can begin enjoying your first microgreen crop!

I have enjoyed growing microgreens with Larry and Zhanna Hountz of City-Hydro in Baltimore, and love their open source policy with their company. Their goal is to share their knowledge with as many people as they can so people can enjoy growing “micros” and experience the health benefits they have to offer.
