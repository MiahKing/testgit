<p>
Just as humans needs nutrients to grow, plants need them to grow as well. A lot of those nutrients are stored in the seed of the plant to ensure that the plant has enough energy and nutrients to start forming roots and sprouting leaves. The first two leaves that sprout are the cotyledons, or embryonic leaves. These leaves are packed with nutrients for the plant. However, if you harvest your microgreens at this stage of the plant growth, all of those nutrients are available for you. Itâ€™s like a concentrated powerhouse of nutrition without waiting for a full plant to grow.

<p>
By growing and eating your own microgreens, you are benefitting from the nutrients of the plants and have confidence that there are no pesticides or herbicides. If a clean way of eating that not only tastes delicious, but offers a bright vibrant plate that is a feast for your eyes, too!
